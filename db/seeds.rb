art2 = Art.create title: 'Mona Lisa', description: "Mona Lisa, also called Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, Italian La Gioconda, or French La Joconde, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the worldâ€™s most famous painting. It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitterâ€™s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.", image_url: 'https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.overstockart.com%2Foptimized%2Fcache%2Fdata%2Fproduct_images%2FLDV1497-1000x1000.jpg&f=1&nofb=1', artist_id: a2.id, exhibit_id: e2.id, medium: 'oil on canvas'

In the next section, the 12 prophets and the sibyls are represented seated on large thrones. Groups of painted figures referring to Christâ€™s ancestors are painted in the eight spandrels of the ceiling. Lastly, Michelangelo depicted the salvation of Israel in the four pendentives at the corners of the dome.', image_url: 'https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FizezNVXmWTj2Udd9dFNM8ygbSsx8uERJDx0-TB_kdhc.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df1b53a740f6252cebacdcadd61d5168fd720aa67&f=1&nofb=1', medium: 'tiny food', artist_id: a4.id, exhibit_id: e3.id
art4 = Art.create title: 'Rembrandt Self Portrait', description: "Rembrandt's self-portraits were created by the artist looking at himself in a mirror,[16] and the paintings and drawings therefore reverse his actual features. In the etchings the printing process creates a reversed image, and the prints therefore show Rembrandt in the same orientation as he appeared to contemporaries.[17] This is one reason why the hands are usually omitted or 'just cursorily described' in the paintings; they would be on the 'wrong' side if painted from the mirror.[18] References to large mirrors occur at various points from the 1650s, and the later portraits include several showing him at a longer length than before; about 80 cm was the maximum height for a sheet of mirror glass technically possible in Rembrandt's lifetime. One may have been bought about 1652 and then sold in 1656 when he went bankrupt. In 1658 he asked his son Titus to arrange delivery of another one, which broke en route to his house.", image_url: 'https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkeyassets.timeincuk.net%2Finspirewp%2Flive%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F8%2F2019%2F03%2FDHW89P.jpg&f=1&nofb=1', medium: 'mosaic', artist_id: a3.id, exhibit_id: e4.id
